# Contributing to the Games Repository

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This repository contains multiple small game projects. Contributions can target the repository itself (docs, CI, meta issues) or individual subprojects (feature work, bug fixes).

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a descriptive branch: `git checkout -b myfix/short-description`.
3. Make your changes and run any project-specific tests or builds.
4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and the motivation.

Guidelines

- When making changes to a specific game, prefer creating changes in that game's subfolder and mention which project the PR targets.
- Keep PRs focused and document how to test the change.
- Respect existing code style in the target project (TypeScript projects use the project's linters/formatters).

Reporting issues

- Open an issue in this repo and include: summary, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment (OS/browser).

Code of conduct

By contributing you agree to follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` at the repository root.
